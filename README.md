# FrontEnd Challenge

#### Congratulations if you received the link of this repository to begin the first part of your interview at NonDutch!

> We hate doing tests but they are useful to filter out the best candidates.

 You need to build an application using any of the following technologies:
 
 - React;
 - React Native;
 - Angular (5);
 - VueJS.
 
 The application will be about `Star Wars` and should do the following:
 
 - [ ] Consume [SWAPI] (Star Wars API);
 - [ ] List planets in the movies (`name` and `population`);
 - [ ] Open the details of a planet (`name`, `population`, `diameter`, `climate`, `gravity` and name of the `films`);
 - [ ] List the people in the movies with basic data (`name` and `height`);
 - [ ] Open the details of a person (`name`, `height`, `gender`, `birth_year`, `hair_color`, `skin_color`, `homeworld`, and name of the `films`);
    - [ ] Link the homeworld to "Planet detail" screen.

 To provide the code you must fork this repository (**which must remain as private**), do your changes and send an email back with the link to it stating that you finished the test.
